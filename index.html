        Moderately Harder Hangman adds a little twist to the your everyday hangman. This twist is simply its increase difficulty.
        Sometimes you can already lose in regular hangman even if you knew the word, so what would happen if you didnt't.
        <br>
        <br>
        The game uses an API to get unconventional words from the internet. Hints are shown in the form of its definition
        on the upper right box in the game.
