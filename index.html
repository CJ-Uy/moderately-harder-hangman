        Welcome to MODERATELY HARDER HANGMAN! 
        <br>
        <br>
        As you can infer from the title of this game. This is hangman but moderately harder. So much so that there are
        lifelines and definitions given to you during each round!    
        <br>
        <br>

        Moderately Harder Hangman adds a little twist to the your everyday hangman. This twist is simply its increase diffculty. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes you can already lose in regular hangman even if you knew the word, so what would happen if you didnt't.
        This is exactly why I have also added features such as the reveal and gambler lifelines which you can use as much as you can.
        The definition of the word is also shown on the upper right of the game screen incase you also might want Google's help. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The game gets its unconventional words from a word API I had happened to have come across.

        This basics of this game has not changed! You enter your own guess in the input box then simply
        click the confirm button or click the enter key. The program will then check if your guess is correct or wrong.
        Every wrong answer bring the man closer to his hanging. If you finish guessing the word before the man is hanged
        YOU WIN!
        <br>
        <br>
        You start of with a score of 15.
        <br>
        However, every wrong guess subtracts it by 1 and reaching 0 is also a game over! In other words you have a
        toal of 15 guesses.

        <p>
          Lifelines in this game are treated slightly differently. Unlike other games where lifelines can only be used once,
          here you can use them as much as you CAN. I say can because at some point you may not have enough points to use them.

          <p id="reveal_lifeline">
            This is the REVEAL LIFELINE. Long story short, it subtracts some of your score to reveal a letter of the word.
            The amount of point deducted depends on how many unique letter the word has. This is so the player cannot simply click
            the Reveal Lifeline until the word is fully shown. 
            <br>
            The calculation to determinethe deduction of points is <br> ⌈ 15 / # of unique letters ⌉
          </p>

          <p id="gambler_lifeline">
            This is the GAMBLER LIFELINE. This lifeline when clicked simply gives you a chance to gain 1 point or lose 1 point.
            <br>
            <br>
            This simple lifeline can be well paired with the Reveal Lifeline as you could use the Gambler to earn points to be used
            for the reveal lifeline. You must be careful however or rather you must be lucky!
